🧠✉ Tired of typing repetitive email replies? Let AI do it for you in one click.

I’ve built a Chrome extension — Smart AI Email Writer Assistant — that integrates directly into Gmail and adds a powerful “Smart AI Reply” button inside your compose window. 📨

Just click once, and like magic, an AI-generated professional reply appears — context-aware and tone-smart.
Perfect for busy professionals, support teams, or just lazy typers like me 😄.

🔗 Install the Chrome Extension:

💡 But hey, if you're not a Chrome fan or feeling lazy to install — no worries, I’ve got your back!

You can also use the web app version of this tool, live at:
🌐 **https://email-writer-ui.vercel.app/**

Just paste your email, optionally select a tone, and 💥 boom — you get a smart, AI-generated reply.
The app supports Light and Dark themes too 🌗 — because smart replies deserve a smart UI 😉

🚀 Under the Hood — Tech Stack:
🧠 AI Engine: Google Gemini (via Spring AI)
☕ Backend: Java + Spring Boot (deployed on Render)
⚛ Frontend: React (deployed on Vercel)
📦 Extension: Manifest v3 Chrome Extension (Gmail UI integrated)
🔗 API Flow:
User → Frontend → Spring Boot Backend → Gemini AI → Smart Reply → Displayed

💡 Why AI?
Emails can be time-consuming. With LLM-powered replies, this tool automates routine responses while keeping the tone professional and personal.
It’s a small step toward using AI to make communication faster, smarter, and easier.

Whether you're replying to clients or catching up on unread threads — this tool brings the power of AI to your inbox.

Give it a spin and let me know your feedback! I'd love to keep improving it 🚀
